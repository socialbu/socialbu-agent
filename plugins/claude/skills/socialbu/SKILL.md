# Social Media Scheduler by SocialBu

Schedule and publish posts, manage your connected accounts and publishing queues, and review results through SocialBu. Use the MCP tools as the source of truth for the authenticated workspace and available capabilities.

## Connect

Connect the hosted MCP server at `https://socialbu.com/mcp` using Streamable HTTP and OAuth. Complete authorization in the user's browser on SocialBu. Keep passwords and access tokens out of chat and configuration files.

In OpenClaw, open **Settings → MCP**, add `socialbu` with that URL and the Streamable HTTP transport, and set `auth` to `oauth` in the scoped configuration editor. Select **Sign in**, complete authorization, then check the connection. Follow the [OpenClaw MCP connection guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/mcp) if the installed version uses different controls.

A SocialBu account is required. SocialBu offers a 7-day free trial; continued use requires a [paid plan](https://socialbu.com/pricing). Installing this skill supplies instructions; connect the MCP server separately if the client does not install it from the package.

## Establish context

- Call `get_current_user` when timezone, subscription, or identity affects the request.
- Call `list_accounts` or `search_accounts` when the destination account is not already identified by a valid ID.
- Use only accounts and teams returned for the authenticated user.
- Treat the runtime tool list as authoritative. Plans, permissions, account types, and connected networks can limit operations.

## Schedule social media posts

For a request such as "schedule these posts next week", read [references/publishing.md](references/publishing.md). Resolve the account and timezone, check existing scheduled posts, prepare each destination's content and media, and create only the posts the user authorized. Return their actual IDs, states, and local schedule times.

For a content calendar or draft plan before connecting an account, use the separate `social-media-calendar` skill when it is installed.

## Choose the relevant workflow

- For drafts, scheduling, publishing, approvals, deletion, and media, read [references/publishing.md](references/publishing.md).
- For connected accounts, teams, reconnection, and custom queues, read [references/accounts-and-queues.md](references/accounts-and-queues.md).
- For performance reporting, read [references/analytics-and-ai.md](references/analytics-and-ai.md).
- For automations, curated content, and Listen streams or items, read [references/automation-curation-and-listen.md](references/automation-curation-and-listen.md).

## Operating rules

- Use `get_post_options` before creating or materially changing a post when network-specific options may apply.
- Interpret every scheduling timestamp as UTC in `Y-m-d H:i:s` format. Convert from the user's timezone when needed.
- Do not publish, delete, disconnect an account, approve or reject a post, change an automation, or remove listening data unless the user's request authorizes that action.
- If the user already gave clear authorization and the target is unambiguous, proceed without asking them to repeat it.
- Verify the destination account, content, media, scheduled time, and requested post state before a consequential action.
- Return the actual SocialBu result. Never invent a post, account, metric, publish result, or successful mutation.
- Explain actionable API or permission errors without exposing tokens, signed upload URLs after use, or private account data unrelated to the request.
